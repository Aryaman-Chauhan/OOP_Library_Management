# OOP_Library_Management
In this repository, we students of BITS Pilani of Group 34 and Group 64 will work together to create a library management system with the following abilities:

## Project 4
### Bits Library Management System

**User Mode (for Students):**
+ Register in the library portal
+ Can search for the book from the bookâ€™s collection
+ Submit a request to issue a book
+ When a due date is about to come up, the student should be able to either reissue the book or deposit the book
+ Should be able to view the dues on the library account.

**Admin Mode (for Librarian):**
+ Manage details of students and books
+ Able to add/remove books from the collection 

**Also, we have the following constraints:**
+ A student is limited to three book checkouts.
+ A student can keep a book for at most 15 days.
+ If a student returns a book after the deadline, the system should be able to calculate the charges and add it to the existing dues.

Concepts expected to be incorporated into the project: **Multithreading** (to handle multiple requests for submitting issue requests), inheritance, interfaces, Swing framework (Java)/React (JS) for GUI [GUI will earn 5 marks bonus and is not mandatory to be implemented]

Testing will be done using test cases entered through a text file and outputs printed to another text file. Test case format and sample test cases will be uploaded after the 1st phase of submission.
